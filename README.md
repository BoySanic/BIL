Brainfuck Intermediary Language

This is a project I started that aims to create an intermediary language between, well, Brainfuck and your brain, I guess.


Syntax:

Add(How much to add)
Subtract(how much to subtract)
Left(How many cells left to travel)
Right(How many cells Right to travel)
{} (The same as [])
Print (Same as .)
Input (Same as ,)
